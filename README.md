# UI Assessment – Checkbox & Panel

This repository contains a small UI implementation built as part of an assessment.

## Overview

The project demonstrates:

- A selectable list with a “select all” control
- Custom checkbox interactions and states
- A simple panel layout with header, content, and footer
- State management using React hooks

The focus is on translating a given design into a working UI with consistent behavior across interactions.

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- CSS (component-scoped styles)
- react-icons

## Notes

This is intentionally scoped to the assessment requirements and is not intended as a full design system or production-ready library.

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
